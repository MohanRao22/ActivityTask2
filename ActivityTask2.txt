1. List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) vs  Nodejs

Browser JS(console):
===============
* Javascript is scripting / programming language which runs code in Browser
* It is basically used for client side.
* JS can capable to add HTML elements and we can play with Document Object Model(DOM).
* In js we don't reqiure any modules we simply work with browser console.
* It is mainly used for front-end validation



Node JS(console):
=============
* NodeJS is an run time environment for Javascript which runs  outside the browser
* It is basically used for server side.
* In nodejs we cannot play with DOM.
* In nodejs everything is in module
* It is mainly used for back-end logic writing


2. watch & summary 5 points - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc&ab_channel=JSConf


1. Html file is parsed using HTML PARSER and creates DOM TREE.(Document object Model).
2. Css file is parsed using CSS PARSER and creates CSSOM TREE(Cascading Style Sheet Object Model).
3. It creates both the trees and interact with Js using Js engine. (for e.g: v8,chakra)
4. While Using script, link, Style -> external  reference file the execution of DOM stops and go to particular file renders the file and then continues the DOM rendering.
5. While placing script, it is recommeded that the script should be bottom within the body element. Because the actual dom renders and finally external files loads.
6. we can use attribute defer/async to script which prevents the file is not painted on screen untill all file loads in the website.
7. It renders over render-object, render-style, line-boxes, layers



3. Execute the below code and write your description in txt file
       typeof(1)  
         --> 1 is integer belongs to 'number' datatype

       typeof(1.1)
         --> 1.1 is float belongs to 'number' datatype

       typeof('1.1')
          --> '1.1' is string belongs to 'string' datatype

       typeof(true)
         --> true belongs to 'boolean' Datatype

       typeof(null)
         --> null belong to 'object' datatype

       typeof(undefined)
          --> undefined belong to 'undefined' datatype 

       typeof([])
         ---> array [] belong to 'object' datatype

       typeof({})
       --> object {} belong to 'object' datatype

       typeof(NaN)
          -> NaN belong to 'number' Datatype
